The Dash
====
A simple single-page application that works as a dashboard for SickBeard. It's built with the Node.js framework Meteor. It's a reimplementation of a simple static site that does the same thing. You can find this version in the repo [static-dash](http://github.com/Essoen/static-dash).

### Features
- Lists upcoming and downloaded episodes from SickBeard (almost)
- Shortcuts to your favorite services (SABnzbd, CouchPotato and SickBeard)
- @TODO: Lets you open the downloaded episodes directly in VLC (eg. get the  URL)
- @TODO: Let's you check off the episodes you've seen (not finished)
- @TODO: Settings-page and implemet CoachPotato-support (with the option to turn that on or off)

### Installation
1. Install [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) 
2. Get all the files and start the server:
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:Essoen/Dash.git
$ cd Dash
$ meteor
```
